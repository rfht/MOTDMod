MOTDMod
=======

MOTDMod is a simple mod for a StardewValley server to send a message of the day
to new players after they join. It uses SMAPI and needs to be built with
MSBuild if building from source.

The code is released under ISC license (see LICENSE).

Note: The main repo is the CVS at

https://thfr.info/cgi-bin/cvsweb/projects/StardewValleyMods/MOTDMod

This is mirrored to GitHub at

Limitations
-----------

- The chat window seems to truncate a single message at 411 characters.
- The last line in the chat window is partly cut off because of the font
  placement.
